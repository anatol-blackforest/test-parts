    <h4>2. What we collect and why</h4>
    <p>To the extent permissible under applicable law, we collect information about you and any other party whose
      details (the "Personal Data") you provide to us when you: </p>

    <ul class="pointed">
      <li>register to use our Services (including free trials); this may include your name (including business name),

        business and your preferences;

        on our website or within our Services;
      </li>
      <li>interact with us using social media;</li>
      <li>provide your contact details to us when registering to use or accessing any Services we make available or when
        you update those details; and
      </li>
      <li>contact us offline, for example by telephone, fax, SMS, email or post.</li>
      <li>information that we collect automatically when you visit our website, such as information about your browser
        settings and other information collected through cookies.
      </li>
      <li>payment processing - when you buy something from us, we ask you to provide your name, contact information, and
        credit card information or other payment account information. When you submit your card information, we store
        the name and address of the cardholder, the expiry date and the last four digits of the credit card number. We
        do not store the actual credit card number. For quick processing of future payments, if you have given us your
        approval, we may store your credit card information or other payment information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 16, and therefore, Danavero does not knowingly acquire
      or receive Personal Data from children under the age of 16. If we later learn that any user of our Service is
      under the age of 16, we will take appropriate steps to remove that user's information from our account database
      and will restrict that individual from future access to the Service.</p>

    <p><strong>Personal Data from Third Party Sources.</strong> We may use third-party services, such as open search
      tools and social networks, to obtain information about you (such as your name or company) and to enrich your
      personal information by obtaining publicly available information about you, such as your job title, employment
      history and contact information.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Your rights relating to your information we collect</h4>
    <p>You have the right under this Privacy Policy and by law if you are within the EU, to:</p>
    <ul class="pointed">
      <li>request access to your Personal Data. If you are within the EU, this enables you to receive a copy of the
        Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
      </li>
      <li>request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
        inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
      </li>
      <li>request erasure of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where
        there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right if you are within the EU to ask
        us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see
        below).
      </li>
      <li> object to processing of your Personal Data. This right exists where we are relying on a legitimate interest
        as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you
        want to object to processing of your Personal Data on this ground. You also have the right to object where we
        are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
      </li>
      <li>request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
        processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for
        processing it.
      </li>
      <li>request the transfer of your Personal Data. If you are within the EU, we will provide to you, or a third party
        you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this
        right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
        the information to perform a contract with you.
      </li>
      <li>withdraw consent. This right only exists where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data
        ("Consent Withdrawal"). If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to the
        certain specific functionalities of our Site. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
        your consent.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to exercise your rights.</strong> If you want to exercise any of the rights described above, please
      contact us using the contact details in Who we are.</p>

    <p>Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
      However, except in relation to Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly
      unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
      access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
      Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you
      for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
    <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if
      your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and
      keep you updated.</p>

    <h4>4. How we use information we collect</h4>
    <p>Danavero uses Personal Data to: (i) provide, administer, and improve our Service; (ii) better understand your
      needs and interests; (iii) fulfill requests you make; (iv) personalize your experience; (v) provide Service
      announcements; (vi) provide you with information and offers from Danavero and our business partners and (vii)
      comply with legal obligations.</p>

    <p>In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Data, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we
      have a legal basis for that use if you are within the EU. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how
      you use them. This means we collect and use your Personal Data only where:</p>

    <ul class="pointed">
      <li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and
        personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>
      <li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for
        research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; or</li>
      <li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may also rely on your consent as a legal basis for using your Personal Data where we have expressly sought it
      for a specific purpose. If we do rely on your consent to a use of your Personal Data, you have the right to change
      your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place). </p>
    <p>For example, we use Personal Data to:</p>
    <p>Operate and improve the Service</p>
    <ul class="pointed">
      <li>Learn more about our users and their internet behaviors</li>
      <li>Target offers to users</li>
      <li>Provide user support</li>
      <li>Communicate with users regarding support, security, technical issues, commerce, marketing, and transactions</li>
      <li>Administer the Service, User Accounts</li>
      <li>Enforce our contracts, administering and carrying out our obligations under contracts, and complying with the
        law</li>
    </ul>

      us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to
      perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we'll remain responsible for their
      handling of your information per our instructions. We also share Personal Data to our service providers provide us
      support for our Services, including, for example, website and application development, hosting, maintenance,
      backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require
      them to access or use Personal Data about you.</p>

    <p>Danavero may disclose your Personal Data if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law,
      regulation, order, and subpoena or to protect our legal rights, interests. </p>


    <h4>6. Retention period</h4>

    <p>
      We will not retain personal information longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed,
      including the security of our processing complying with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g. audit, accounting
      and statutory retention terms), handling disputes, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims
      in the countries where we do business.

      accessed by us, our staff, sub-contractors and third parties with whom we share Personal Data in the Canada or

      and use as specified in this Privacy Notice. Note the laws of the Canada might not be as comprehensive or
      protective as laws in the country where you live.</p>

    <h4>8. How we protect your Personal Data</h4>
    <p>We take administrative, technical and physical measures to safeguard your personal information against
      unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, theft and misuse. This includes limiting access of employees to, and
      the use of, your personal information through the use of passwords and graduated levels of clearance to those who
      have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner
      and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We do not publish all of our security measures online because this
      may reduce their effectiveness. We take physical precautions to ensure that the computer servers on which your
      personal information is stored and archived are secure and that access to such servers is protected. We educate
      our employees with respect to their obligations to protect your personal information and we require our affiliates
      and any third-party service providers to take comparable steps to ensure the protection of any of your personal
      information that is shared with them.</p>

    <p>We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any
      applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

    <p>Although we take precautions against possible breaches of our security systems, no company can fully eliminate
      the risks of unauthorized access to your personal information and no website is completely secure. We cannot
      guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or breaches of our security systems will never occur.
      Accordingly, you should not transmit personal information to us using our website if you consider that information
      to be sensitive.</p>

      and we also measure your activity on the website, but we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous.
